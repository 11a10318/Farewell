Greets

As you probably noticed, I've been pretty inactive recently.
Sorry to anybody who was expecting more to come out, but I think this is it.
I've had a lot of things happen IRL, and I've had to seriosuly re-evaluate what's important to me.
Unfortunately, making hacks for and reversing a videogame that I've never even finished is not very high on my priority list.

The zip attached contains the source for all of my wizard101-related projects.
There's a few things in there that you probably haven't seen, but they probably won't be of much value to the general public.
I also started a data-mining/hacking guide, but never finished it. There's a bit of useful information in there, but most of it's public knowledge anyway.
If anybody wants to continue it, feel free to do so.

Everything is now public, open source, and unlicensed.

I know I said I was upset when people were selling my shit, but fuck it. I don't care anymore, and won't be around to enforce anything.

I'm also shutting down the KICodeGen bot (as well as any other kihax-related websites).
WizTool has the same codegen built into it, so the bot's pretty pointless anyway.

The discord server will stay up, but it will probably die soon anyway.
Here's the invite link if anybody wants it:

It's been a good run.
Thank you to everybody who helped me along the way, it was a pleasure to know you all.

Sorry I left so many things unfinished, but I just can't do this anymore.
Maybe in another life, eh?
